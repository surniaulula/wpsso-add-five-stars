Add a 5 star rating and review from the site organization if the Schema markup does not already have an 'aggregateRating' property.

== Description ==

<!-- about -->

**The WPSSO Add Five Stars add-on will include a 5 star rating and review from the site organization in the Schema markup if:**

1. The Schema markup for the document does not have an 'aggregateRating' property.
2. Google allows an 'aggregateRating' property for the selected document Schema type.

**Google allows an 'aggregateRating' property for these Schema types and their sub-types:**

* Book
* Course
* Event
* HowTo (includes Recipe)
* LocalBusiness
* Movie
* Product
* SoftwareApplication

If the Schema type in the Document SSO metabox is not one of these types or sub-types, then a 5 star rating and review cannot be added.

<h3>The WPSSO Add Five Stars add-on Should be a Fallback Solution</h3>

The Google's Review Snippet technical guidelines reminds us to:

> [Make sure the reviews and ratings you mark up are readily available to users from the marked-up page. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has review content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/review-snippet#technical-guidelines).

The WPSSO Add Five Stars add-on will include a 5 star rating *if the document Schema markup does not have an 'aggregateRating' property* - it is preferable to include actual ratings and reviews from your visitors and customers in the webpage.

<h3>Suggested Rating and Review Plugins and Services</h3>

The [WPSSO Core Premium plugin](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/) supports a number of third-party plugins and remote service APIs offering rating and review features:

* **Supported third-party plugins:**

	* WP-PostRatings
	* WP Product Review
	* Yotpo Social Reviews for WooCommerce
	* WooCommerce

* **Supported service APIs:**

	* Shopper Approved (Ratings and Reviews)
	* Stamped.io (Ratings and Reviews)

Alternatively, if your site already uses the built-in WordPress commenting system, the [WPSSO Ratings and Reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-ratings-and-reviews/) add-on can be used to extend the WordPress comment system with rating and review features.
